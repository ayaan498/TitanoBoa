 This is a Discord-like chat application using Django (with the guidance of youtuber Mr.Dennis Ivy)
 
Authentication: Developed a secure authentication system for the user to log in or sign up.

Database CRUD: Implemented CRUD operations where chat-rooms as well as user chats can be created,
updated or deleted.

Features: Implemented multi-user conversation in the chat-rooms, multiple filters and a search bar to search
for the desired topic or chat-room, an activity feed to track the recent events and a profile page for each user.
Added CSRF tokens to protect the website from malicious attacks.

API: Built a REST API using Django REST Framework.
